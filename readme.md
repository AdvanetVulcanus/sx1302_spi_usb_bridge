# Corecell USB STM

Corecell USB STM is the project that manage communication between a host, generally a linux host, and the radio front end (SX1302/SX1303 & SX1261).
The µC is mainly a SPI-USB bridge.
The communication is achieve through a USB VPC (Virtual Port Com)


## Compiler & IDE

This project has been developp with [STM32CubeIDE](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html) (Version: 1.2.0)

This IDE includes everything that is required to compile & debug the project on the µC.


## Project configuration

The project configuration (clock, gpio, spi, usb, ...) has been done with STM32CubeMX. 

If you re-generate the project with STM32CubeMX, some files and project define will be overwritten. These files has been lightly modified and these modifications needs to be re-apply.Git discard is good tools find them and cancel the modification.

Search for the the tag  **@CUSTOM_SEMTECH** and re-apply them 

The project define **#DEBUG** will be add in the release. Please remove it. 


## Boot mode

This project can force the µC in boot mode (USB DFU boot mode). If modification to the source code is made, it is critical to check that the new firmware still allow the use of the boot command.
